0.1.0 Changelog 

- worlds now have different locations. World size limit is currently 256
- command "move left/right" to visit different locations
- locations are of randomly selected biomes, forest, plains, jungle, ocean, river, lava lake and volcano
- caves now exist within locations, so different locations have different caves. Different biomes have a different chance of generating cave
- caves now have a limited number of stone
- the chance of ore generation is a logarithmic function of progress, which is the total number of blocks you have mined in that cave. The chance is doubled if it is immediately after mining a block. In general, the ore generation rates have been reduced
- trees also now exist within a location, with number of trees based on the biome
- inventory now displays items in the order they were collected
- player health can now be something point 5, although currently only achievable using the "set_health" command
- changed intro text

Current bugs
- using the give command, you can enter any string and you will get that thing
- only the "go forest" or "back" command is understood to exit a cave, even if the biome is not a forest
- stone and ores can be mined with any pickaxe and even without
- mobs are not mentioned by the "view" command
- lack of help page
- mobs do not have a location yet
- trees currently do not have a way to regrow after being chopped down
- treasure chests do not currently generate naturally

Please report any bugs you find

Future planned features
- water, lava and obsidian

0 : General

This is a text RPG with flexible gameplay. This game is based on Minecraft, a popular sandbox video game by Mojang. 

In this game, you can collect resources from the world by using the "mine" command. You can use these resources to make further equipment such as tools, weapons and armour by using the "craft" command. 

There is an in-game time, which increments for every successful active move you make. For times 0 to 19, it is daytime. For times 20 to 35, it is nighttime and the cycle repeats afterwards. In the daytime, trees grow, animals like pigs spawn and the player can collect resources. At night, hostile mobs (monsters) such as zombies and endermen start to spawn and will attack the player. The player has 10 health. The player can battle these mobs and they may even drop valuable resources upon death. However, if the player is killed, the game ends. The player can choose to skip the night by sleeping in a bed. 

The goal of the game is to journey to the end and kill the enderdragon, an evil boss mob. 

In the following rough guide, commands that can be typed to perform the actions are shown in [""].

The player begins in the forest location, where trees will grow and mobs (creatures) can spawn. The player can begin by collecting wood ["chop tree" or "mine tree"]. The wood can be used to craft a wooden_pickaxe ["craft wooden_pickaxe"] which allows the player to mine stone. 

The player can enter the cave ["enter cave"] and mine stone ["mine stone"]. The cave can randomly generate other valuable resources such as iron and diamond. diamond can only generate from the second day and after. spider is a hostile mob that can spawn in the cave, even in the daytime. However, they deal much less damage in the daytime than nighttime. 

The player can exit the cave ["exit"] and use the stone collected to craft other tools such as stone_pickaxe ["craft stone_pickaxe"] and stone_sword ["craft stone_sword"]. A stone_pickaxe is required to mine iron ["mine iron"], and an iron_pickaxe is required to mine diamond ["mine diamond"]. 

pig is a friendly mob (creature) that spawns in the forest randomly. When mobs spawn, you will see a message like "You see a (mob type), (mob name)". e.g. "You see a pig, pig0". Mob names are assigned as follows: pig0, pig1, pig2, pig3 etc. The player can attack mobs ["attack (mob name)" or "kill (mob name)"]. The damage that is dealt is determined by the current sword that the player has. Remember that hostile mobs such as spider and zombie can attack the player too! For more info about the mobs, see "Mobs". For more info on swords and armour, see "Items". For more info on how to make these items and others, see "Crafting"

The pig drops meat upon death. Meat can be eaten ["eat meat"] to heal health. Sometimes trees also give you apple which can also be eaten to heal health ["eat apple"]. 

Chests can generate rarely in the forest or cave. You can open them ["open chest"] and you may get valuable loot!

When the in-game time reaches 20, it becomes nighttime and hosile mobs will begin to spawn. The hostile mobs are zombie, witch and enderman. witch and enderman are much stronger and will only spawn from the second night onwards. For more information about these mobs, see "Mobs". To avoid facing these mobs, the player can make a bed ["craft bed"] and sleep ["sleep"]. 

The enderman, a mob that spawns from the second night and after, drops eye_of_ender upon death, which can be used to craft end_portal ["craft end_portal"] to allow the player to journey to the end ["enter end"] to battle the enderdragon. For more info about the end, see "End". The witch drops many useful items such as potion_bottle which can be used to make health_potion ["craft health_potion"]. For more info on how to make these items, see "Crafting". For more info on what these items do, see "Items"

-------------------------------------------------
2 : Items

Items are objects that the player can collect and keep in their inventory. Enter "inventory" or "i" or "e" to check your inventory. 

Items have many uses. Some items can be obtained from crafting and other can be used to craft other items. Some items can be eaten to heal health. 

Pickaxes are required to mine certain objects. Swords are what determine the damage dealt to mobs when you attack them. Armour will block damage from mob attacks. 

The player begins with no pickaxe, no sword (which deals 1 damage) and no armour. When pickaxes, swords and armour are crafted, the game will automatically update the current pickaxe, armour or sword that the player is using or eqquipped with, if the new one is better than the current one. Hence, the game will automatically ensure that the player is always using the best pickaxe, armour or weapon all the time. You can check your current pickaxe, sword or armour by typing "pickaxe", "sword" or "armour".

Remember to spell items correctly and with an underscore if it has multiple words (e.g. wooden_pickaxe) when typing commands.

-------------------------------------------------
3 : Crafting

Crafting is done by using the "craft" command. You must also specify the item that you are crafting. 

You need to have a crafting_table to craft items when not in the forest, e.g. in the cave. When doing so, there is a small chance that the crafting_table will break and be consumed. 

The following is a list of all the items that can be crafted and what is needed to do so. For more info on these items, see "Items".


wood => stick
stick + 2 wood => wooden_pickaxe
stick + 2 stone => stone_pickaxe
stick + 2 iron => iron_pickaxe
stick + 2 diamond => diamond_pickaxe
3 wood => bed
4 wood => crafting_table
stick + wood => wooden_sword
stick + stone => stone_sword
stick + iron => iron_sword
stick + diamond => diamond_sword
3 iron => iron_armour
3 diamond => diamond_armour
potion_bottle + spider_eye => health_potion
4 stone + 2 iron + diamond => portal_frame
3 eye_of_ender + 3 portal_frame => end_portal
meat + stick => satay
dragon_skin => dragon_armour



-------------------------------------------------
4 : Mobs

Mobs are creatures that spawn (appear) randomly in their spawning location if the player is in that location too. When a mob spawns, you will see the message "You see a (mob type), (mob name)" e.g. "You see a pig, pig0". Mob names are assigned as follows: pig0, pig1, pig2, pig3 etc. 

Mobs have health. The player can attack mobs by using the "attack" command, followed by the mob name. The damage that is dealt is determined by the current sword that the player has. When mobs die, they have a chance to drop certain items, some can be highly valuable. 

Hostile mobs will also begin to attack the player one unit of time after spawning, continuing to do so every unit of time afterwards until they are killed or the player is, or the player moves to another location. The damage dealt will be reduced if the player is equipped with armour.  

Mobs begin to attack the player 1 unit of time after spawning, so it is not immediate. Since attacking mobs is processed before mob attacking players, if you kill a mob in one hit, it will not have the chance to attack you. 

Mobs cannot change their location, i.e. they cannot follow the player into the cave or into the end. 

Only one mob of the same type spawns at once, but different mobs can spawn at the same time. Multiple mobs can appear and attack simultaneously. There is a mob cap that prevents too many mobs to appear at once, however the hostile mob cap is increased as time goes by. If you wish to avoid facing mobs at night, you can choose to sleep to skip the night.

Mobs can also spawn by using the "spawn" or "summon" command, which needs cheats to be turned on. 

The following is a list of all the mob types. 


pig

Spawning: forest, anytime,lower chance at night
Drops: 1-3 meat 
Health: 4

zombie 
Hostile

-------------------------------------------------
5 : End

To win the game, the player has to journey to the end to kill the enderdragon. To do so, the player must make an end_portal. See the following crafting recipes:

4 stone + 2 iron + diamond => portal_frame

3 eye_of_ender + 3 portal_frame => end_portal

eye_of_ender is dropped by endermen upon death. 

You cannot return to the forest once you are in the end, until you defeat the enderdragon. If you do so, you can return to the forest. After that, if you enter the end again, another enderdragon will spawnand you also cannot leave until you defeat it. Each enderdragon you kill will drop a dragon_skin, but only the first one will drop the dragon_egg


enderdragon

Health: 200
Example health bar:
                    ENDERDRAGON
+--------------------------------------------------+
|////////////////////////////////////////          |
+--------------------------------------------------+

Name: enderdragon or ed

Spawing: end, once when the player enters

Drops: dragon_egg (first enderdragon only), dragon_skin

Behaviour:

When the dragon is above half health, it is in stage 1. When the dragon is below half health, it is in stage 2. When the enderdragon reaches half health, it will fly off and summon 3 endermen, and only come back when they are killed. 

For stage 1, the enderdragon attacks once every unit of time for 3 consecutive units of time, then flies off for 1 unit of time. For stage 2, the enderdragon attacks once every unit of time for 4 to 5 consecutive units of time and flies off for 2 units of time. 

The enderdragon cannot attack or be damaged when it is flown off. For each unit of time that enderdragon is flying off, it will regenerate 1-3 health (stage 1) or 3-5 health (stage 2). 

When attacking, out of each group of 3-4 attacks, exactly one will be an acid attack (acid breath) and the rest will be melee attacks (bumping into you).

Acid attack damage: 5 - 7 
Melee attack damage: 4 (stage 1), 4 - 5 (stage 2)


When the enderdragon is killed, you will gain the dragon_egg, and will be prompted to return to the forest, which completes the game. You can carry on playing though. 

Just for fun, we grade your performance based on your number of moves taken to complete the game. (Only if you did not turn on cheats)

<= 200: legenday! 
201 - 300: epic!
301 - 350: superb!
401 - 500: awesome!
> 500: great!
